# VBA Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project
The current project is aimed to analyze Stock Market fluctuations to consequently allow the end-users to make informed decisions on the Stock Market arena.
### Purpose
Current projects examines a subset of the Stock Market data between 2017 and 2018 through the use of VBA code snippets to determine whether a particular stock performed well on the market or if it lost its value over time. This quick analysis would allow the end-user to guide their future stock decisions based on the stock behaviour that is available for them thus far.

Additionally, a secondary goal of the current project was to attempt to refacture the associated VBA code to cut on the execution time and provide for a more flexible and less memory-consuming algorithm.
## Results

### Stock Performance For 2017 Versus 2018




### Code Performance Between The Original Script and The Refactored Version




## Summary

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Refactoring Code

### Applicability to Current Code
