# VBA Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project
The current project is aimed to analyze Stock Market fluctuations to consequently allow the end-users to make informed decisions on the Stock Market arena.
### Purpose
Current projects examines a subset of the Stock Market data between 2017 and 2018 through the use of VBA code snippets to determine whether a particular stock performed well on the market or if it lost its value over time. This quick analysis would allow the end-user to guide their future stock decisions based on the stock behaviour that is available for them thus far.

Additionally, a secondary goal of the current project was to attempt to refacture the associated VBA code to cut on the execution time and provide for a more flexible and less memory-consuming algorithm.
## Results

### Stock Performance For 2017 Versus 2018

When comparing the results of stock performance between 2017 and 2018, a number of trends can be immediately identified. First, it should be evident that 2017 was a much more successful year for the stock market overall, with only the TEPR stock category performing negatively during that year. Opposite to that, most of the stocks ended up in the negative skew in 2018 (meaning that they lost in value, as oppoosed to gaining it), with only two stocks - ENPH and RUN - performing positively during said calendar year.

The TERP stock can be identified as a "red flag" anamoly - it lost its value in both 2017 and 2018. As such, one should exercise extreme caution when deciding on whether they would like to buy said stock. On the other hand, ENPH and RUN stocks had a positive closing statement at the end of both years, thus making them a potentially safe bet for stock traders.

Overall, however, it is hard to establish any sort of predictable stock pattern based solely on the two years examined, thus further analysis of the years to follow (i.e., 2019, 2020, 2021) should be considered prior to making any substantial stock market decisions.
